1. If you cannot find your issue, [follow the reproduction steps guide below](#i-want-to-report-a-bug). We will look into it.

## I want to report a bug

1. Find an example in [the documentation](http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/) that looks similar to your case.
1. Open it in Plunker by using the **OPEN AS PLUNKER** button.
1. Modify the plunk, so that the issue is reproducible in it. Try to include the minimum possible amount of code.
1. Save the plunk by using the blue **Save** button at the top.
1. Copy the link from the address bar of the browser.
1. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular/issues/new) and add the plunker link in the description.
1. Provide any additional information necessary for us to reproduce the problem&mdash;for example, browser version, steps to perform, etc.

We might not be able to act on issues **without a runnable demo**.
