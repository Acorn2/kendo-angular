## I am Looking for a Commercial-Grade Support
  
Commercial offering is comming soon&mdash;we are going to enable the channel once the product reaches version 1.0.0.
  
## I Think I Found a Bug
  
Review the [open issues](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular2/issues).  Maybe someone already reported it and it will be fixed soon.

The problem may also be fixed&mdash;in which case, the issue will be in <a href="https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed">the closed list &nearr;</a>.

If you can't find your problem, follow the reproduction steps guide below&mdash;we will look into it.
  
## Steps to File a Bug
  
1. Find an example in the <a href="http://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/">documentation</a> that looks similar to your case;
1. Open it in Plunker, using the "OPEN AS PLUNKER" button;
1. Modify the plunk, so that the problem is reproducible in it. Make sure that you include the minimum amount of code;
1. Save it with the blue "save" button at the top; copy the link from the browser address bar;
1. <a href="https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular2/issues/new">Open a new issue</a>; add the plunker link in the description;
1. Provide any additional information necessary for us to reproduce the problem - browser version, steps to perform, etc.
  
<p>Issues <strong>without a plunker</strong>, or ones that include <strong>unnecessary third-party dependencies</strong> or <strong>application specific implementation</strong> are going to be closed, until a proper reproduction is provided.</p>
  
<p>In case you need assistance with troubleshooting and isolating a problem in your implementation, you may request one from <a href="http://www.telerik.com/professional-services">Telerik's professional services</a>. </p>
