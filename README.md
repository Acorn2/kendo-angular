  <h2 id="bug-reporting" class="h3">I want to report a bug</h2>

  <p>Kendo UI for Angular 2 uses GitHub issues as official bug trackers. The <a href="https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular2">telerik/kendo-angular2</a>
      repository is there for that purpose&mdash;it does not contain the actual components source code.</p>

  <h3 class="h4">Steps</h3>

  <ol>
      <li>Find an example in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/components">documentation</a> that looks similar to your case.</li>
      <li>Open it in Plunker by using the <strong>OPEN AS PLUNKER</strong> button.</li>
      <li>Modify the plunk, so that the issue is reproducible in it. Try to include the minimum possible amount of code.</li>
      <li>Save the plunk by using the blue <strong>Save</strong> button at the top.</li>
      <li>Copy the link from the address bar of the browser.</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/telerik/kendo-angular2/issues/new">Open a new issue</a> and add the plunker link in the description.</li>
      <li>Provide any additional information necessary for us to reproduce the problem such as browser version, steps to perform, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If you submit an issue <strong>without a plunker</strong>, or one that includes <strong>unnecessary
      third-party dependencies</strong> or <strong>application-specific implementation</strong>, the issue will be closed until its proper reproduction is provided.</p>
